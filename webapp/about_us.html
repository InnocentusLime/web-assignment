        <h2>About Hattrick Store</h2>
        <p>Hattrick Store is your go-to store for all possible trends in hats, caps, and panamas.</p>
		<p>We aim to provide high-quality products that inspire and empower 
		our customers to express their unique style.</p>
        <h2>Our history</h2>
		<p>At 22:17 on May 10, 2024, one of us came up with the idea of the flux capacitor after slipping and bumping his head 
		while standing on his toilet to hang a clock. The idea came to him in a vision he had after being knocked out. 
		Since coming up with the idea, he spent a lot of time and most of his family fortune trying to get it to work. 
		At 23:02, the time travel machine was ready. With such a powerful invention in our hands, the idea of how to use it was laying on the surface. 
		We grabbed the Grays Sports Almanac 1950-2000 and went back to 1955 to buy some hats! 
		Brilliant idea to buy hats in the past and sell them nowadays, isn't it? And by the way, if you didn’t like our product, you never bought it! 
		But that was just the beginning. After some problems with the laws of physics and matter, the portal gun was invented. 
		Just one step through the portal and you're in another multiverse. I said, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for our Hattrick business." 
		There is a world where they make hats from salami (bestseller now!). And there is a multiverse where hats wear people, 
		we’re not even sure what we should import from this place (how TRICKY is that, ha?). 
		We brought one hat from there, and now it teaches social psychology at Princeton.</p>
		<p>Of course, we understand that our technologies can cause terrible harm if they fall into the wrong hands. 
		Therefore, after much discussion, we settled on the idea to make this website.</p>
